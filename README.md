## Terrorism-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict terrorism-related activities based on historical data. The goal is to build a classifier that can help identify whether an incident is likely to be terrorist in nature based on its features.

### 📌 Objectives

- Explore and visualize global terrorism trends.
- Preprocess and clean the dataset.
- Train ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
- Evaluate and compare model performance.

### 📁 Dataset

- Source: Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
- Features: Year, Country, Region, Attack Type, Target Type, Weapon Type, Group Name, etc.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (ML models)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (Visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

### ✅ Results

- Model Accuracy: 87%
- Best Performing Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Key Insight: Most attacks were in [Region], using [Weapon Type], by [Group Name].

### 📈 Visualizations

Included in the notebook: 
- Attack count by region
- Trend of terrorism by year
- Attack type distribution

### 🚀 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
- Use deep learning (e.g., LSTM for time trends)
- Build a real-time risk classification tool
